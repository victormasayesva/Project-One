The following functions have problems that keep them from
completing the task that they have to do.

All the problems are either Logical or Syntactical errors with FUNCTIONS.
Focus on the functions and find the problems with the FUNCTIONS.

For this debug, there could be problems with executing the functions. For example,
calling the function may have been done wrong, or put in the wrong spot. So don't
just look at the function itself but also the line calling the function.

Additionally, if converting becomes difficult, ask the instructor about how to
use a conversion table or other tricks to help make sure the conversion is right.

The number of errors are as follows:
ouncesToGallons: 4
gallonsToOunces: 6
gramsToPounds: 4
poundsToGrams: 4
